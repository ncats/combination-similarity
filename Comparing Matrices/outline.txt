Goal: To what extent does single point screening identify hits that are identified using a dose response screen? 
Questions:

1. What is the concordance of compounds selected by dose response and by single concentration
2. How is this concordance affected by
2.1 The concentration of the single point screen
2.2 The target of the screen
2.3 The type of screen
3. Traditional single point screening uses thresholds to select compounds. What happens when we use more complex selection rules (e.g., delayed death screen)
4. Is there a way to suggest a priori (say based on small scale development screens) whether a large primary screen should be run in dose response or as a single point screen?

Workflow
-------

1. Get R environment set up with required packages - installing these will pull in a  bunch of dependencies
* ncgchts
* dplyr
* ggplot2
* reshape2

1.1 Get up to speed with the ncgchts package to retrieve screening datasets

2. Put together a list of screens to examine. This will include large primary screens as well as smaller follow up (but well annotated) screens

3. Define hit selection rules for dose response screens.
3.1 Implement code to identify hits from dose response screens
3.2 Investigate cases where multiple readouts are required for hit selection

4. Define hit selection rules for single point screens
4.1 Implement code to identify hits from single point screens
4.2 Investigate cases where multiple readouts are required for hit selection

5. Define concordance of hits between the two screening methods
* We initially start by assuming dose response hits are the "true" hits
* This implies that single point is equivalent to the dose response screen if the former identifies all hits from the latter
* Are there better ways to do this?

6. Compute concordances for the various datasets and conditions

7. Explore ways to visualize and summarize the concordances (+ conditions)

8. Characterize relation between concordance and assay characteristics (assay format, target, etc)
