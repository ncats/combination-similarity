# Similar Compounds Show Similar Activities- Is This True for Drug Combinations?

There are several medical conditions such as HIV, malaria, and cancer where the response in patients is better when drugs are used together in treatment. This better outcome is called a synergistic effect of the drug combination- the combined effect of the drugs is better than what it would be compared to the drugsâ€™ individual effects. Traditionally, screening for drug combinations has been a slow process. Better understanding which drug combinations show synergistic effects is important for more effective treatments in patients. It is known that similar compounds show similar activities or have similar properties, an important concept in cheminformatics called the [Similarity Property Principle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14965296). However, it is unclear if this is also true for combinations of drugs. 

Since NCATS uses high throughput screening (HTS), data for thousands of drug combinations can be generated quickly. Screening a drug combination at incrementing levels of each drug results in a response surface.  Having thousands of response surface presents the opportunity to do large scale analysis. I had the opportunity this summer to intern for NCATS where I worked on the analysis aspect to see if similar drug combinations have similar properties.
